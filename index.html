        Internet privacy is important because it gives you control over your
        identity and personal information. Without that control, anyone with the
        intention and means can manipulate your identity to serve their goals,
        whether it is selling you a more expensive vacation or stealing your
        savings.

      <p class="pass-2">
        Online safety is the ability to understand and recognize threats that
        exist on the internet, as well as having the skills and knowledge to
        avoid these threats. This includes knowing how to keep personal
        information private and secure online, protecting devices from malware,
        avoiding harmful or illegal content, and managing online relationships
        safely.
