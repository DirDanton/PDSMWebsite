      Cyber999 is a cyber security incident response center operated by MyCERT
      (Malaysia Computer Emergency Response Team) to report incidents of
      cyberbullying that threaten the safety or privacy of internet users. A
      trained Incident Handler will help the complainant resolve the reported
      incident. Incident operators also work with relevant departments at
      CyberSecurity Malaysia or other organisations such as law enforcement
      agencies, regulatory bodies, and internet service providers to help
      resolve the complaints.
